# Day 18 – Dashboard Wireframing (Excel Project)

## Overview

Focused on building the wireframe for my Excel dashboard.

## What I Did

* Structured layout into three sections:

  * KPI Summary (top)
  * Trend Analysis (middle)
  * Breakdown Charts (bottom)
* Adjusted spacing and alignment for better visual flow
* Reworked placement to reduce clutter and improve readability

## Challenge

Choosing between two frame color options:

* Frame 1 – lighter and subtle
* Frame 2 – stronger and more defined

The color changes the overall feel of the dashboard more than I expected.

## Next Step

Finalize the frame color and begin visual styling and interaction testing.
